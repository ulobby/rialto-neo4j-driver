A package to manage Node resources from PHP. It can be used to create bridges to interact with Node libraries in PHP, like [PuPHPeteer](https://github.com/nesk/puphpeteer/).

It works by creating a Node process and communicates with it through sockets.

## Requirements and installation

Rialto requires PHP >= 7.1 and Node >= 8.

Install it in your project:

```shell
composer require nesk/rialto
npm install @nesk/rialto
```

## Support me

Rialto is a project requiring a lot of work (and is the library powering [PuPHPeteer](https://github.com/nesk/puphpeteer)). While I'm happy to work on it on my free time, I also enjoy to drink a couple of beers sometimes with my friends. If you want to support development, buy me a beer at [BeerPay](https://beerpay.io/nesk/rialto). üôè
